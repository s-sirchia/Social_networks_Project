#The operation of retriving advertisers or documents matching a given query can be executed in two phases:
#in the first phase, we build the necessary data structures;
#in the second phase, we answer to the given query.

#The first phase is usually run only once.
#The data structure that is usually built in this phase is an "inverted index".
#This is a dictionary that for every word (or for every query phrase) mantains a list of
#documents containing that word (query phrase) / advertisers requesting to appear on that word (query phrase).
#In this phase, we assume that there is a database in which we save for each document (advertiser, resp.)
#the link to the document (the name of the advertiser, resp.)
#and the list of word (or phrases) of the document (on which the advertiser request to appear, resp.).
#In the implementations below we assume that the database is a file as follows:
#    nome_adv1 prova,test,prova esame,esame,appello,appello esame
#    nome_adv2 prova,esempio,caso semplice,evidenza
#    nome_adv3 esempio test,esempio esame,esempio prova,esame prova

#The second phase must be executed for any issued query.
#Different strategies are available for this phase:
#either we look for an exact match of the query in the document / advertisers' requests
#or we look for document / advertiser' requests that are "good" match, but not necessarily exact.
